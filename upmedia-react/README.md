upmedia-react sample, intended to be used along [upmedia-backend-spring](https://github.com/RevealBi/sdk-samples-java/tree/main/upmedia-backend-spring) or [upmedia-backend-tomcat](https://github.com/RevealBi/sdk-samples-java/tree/main/upmedia-backend-tomcat).

If you're not familiar with React, running:
```sh
npm install
```
and then 
```sh
npm start
```
is enough to have the server running at http://localhost:3000, please be sure to also have the backend server (Spring or Tomcat) running in localhost at port 8080.
