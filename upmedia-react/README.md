# upmedia-react sample
Intended to be used along [upmedia-backend-spring](https://github.com/RevealBi/sdk-samples-java/tree/main/upmedia-backend-spring) or [upmedia-backend-tomcat](https://github.com/RevealBi/sdk-samples-java/tree/main/upmedia-backend-tomcat).

If you're not familiar with React, running:
```sh
npm install
```
and then 
```sh
npm start
```
is enough to have the server running at http://localhost:3000, please be sure to also have the backend server (Spring or Tomcat) running in localhost at port 8080.


**Note:** this is still a work in progress to complete the functionality provided by the standard UpMedia sample included with RevealBI distribution, but it's good enough to show how to use the most important features in React.
